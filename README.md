## [General Info]

This is the ReadMe File for Homework assignment #. For this assignment we were tasked with working out some kinks that we encountered from our first hw assignment and making the necessary adjustments using code sourced from Bootstrap. 

 ## [Assignment Details]

With this assignment we were given the task of setting up our pages using Bootstrap as our guide. We were responsible for making our pages responsive to different device usage as well as implementing columns to make sure the page was organized in a simple manner.  

## [How To Setup]

The files within this document are going to be updated on a regular basis! However....there are some things to be aware of.


1.The css style sheet is located in the assets/css directory. 

2.The images are stored within the same assets/ directory but under the name "images".

3.All of the pages are linked together so feel free to click away to explore!

4.As stated before, this is a work in progress! Notes on things that have not been worked out yet are marked in green notation (or possibly another color depending on what you prefer).


*5.The contact page is the example page for the rest of the document!*

## [Look-Out!]

As stated before the page is still a work in progress! Currently working on a fix to main page regarding positioning of initial content box containing the text and the photo. Also.....the initial css page from the first homework is also copied here moreso as a guide to assist during the styling aspect. The pages get a little funky when it comes to the screen-width changing but that will be updated in due time! Working on a fix to the media query to make sure that the pages work as planned.
